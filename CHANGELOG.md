## Unreleased

### Added

- Align Commerce with the canonical five-repository architecture, including
  the one-way Permit issuer adapter, product/identity boundary, and a bounded
  M1 implementation handoff.
- Add a documentation gate for local links and canonical family-architecture
  references.
- Define the provider-neutral Commerce boundary and its relationship with
  Rivet, Glaze, Keel, and Permit.
- Add the pure payment-event projection core with idempotent replay,
  conflicting-replay rejection, refund-before-payment handling, and rights
  intents.
- Add the server-side provider adapter contract and runnable first-purchase
  walkthrough.
- Add bilingual onboarding, a canonical documentation map, security and
  operations contracts, ADRs, and three-platform CI.
