# Commerce

**One commercial truth for every product — payment events in, signed product rights out.**

**English** · [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Commerce is the provider-neutral commercial management plane for independent
software. It gives every product one place to create checkout sessions, accept
and audit payment events, project orders and subscriptions, and turn commercial
outcomes into signed [Permit](https://github.com/turinglambdaai/permit) rights.

Commerce is not a payment processor, merchant of record, tax engine, CRM, or
DRM system. Pancake, ZPAY, app stores, and future providers remain responsible
for moving money. Permit remains responsible for signed, locally verifiable
rights. Commerce owns the durable orchestration between them.

**Provider-neutral. Event-driven. Rights-first.**

## Quick start

The current release provides the pure event core, replay/conflict protection,
order projections, rights intents, a provider boundary, a durable SQLite raw
event journal, exact-byte Pancake webhook authentication, active Pancake
one-time-order verification, transactional durable projection/outbox storage,
version-pinned Offer-to-Permit snapshot mapping, an owner-safe issuance-outbox
lease state machine with the transactional entitlement-lineage writer, the
explicit Permit issuer worker that signs recorded bytes, records them as
durable credential evidence, and hands the customer a one-time claim token,
the refund and operator replay surface, tests, and one runnable purchase
walkthrough.

```bash
raco pkg install --auto --name commerce \
  https://github.com/turinglambdaai/commerce.git

racket examples/first-purchase.rkt
```

Expected result:

```text
order ord_demo_001: paid
rights intent: grant taskly-pro-lifetime to customer-demo
duplicate webhook: ignored
```

[documentation map](docs/README.md) identifies the canonical guide for every
architectural and operational question.

## Why Commerce?

A product can integrate one checkout in an afternoon. A product family cannot
safely repeat payment verification, retries, refunds, subscription renewal,
credential recovery, and licence issuance in every application.

Commerce creates one durable boundary:

- **Products speak offers and rights** — they never embed provider API keys or
  signing keys.
- **Providers speak payments** — each adapter verifies its native protocol and
  emits the same small canonical event vocabulary.
- **Permit speaks authorization** — Commerce requests complete signed rights
  snapshots; applications verify them locally.
- **Every transition is auditable** — raw events are retained, duplicate
  delivery is harmless, conflicting replay fails closed, and issuance is an
  explicit outbox step rather than a webhook side effect.

## Where it fits

```text
                         Product
                    /       |       \
              Rivet/Glaze  Permit  Commerce client
                    UI      verify       |
                                         v
                                 Commerce service
                              /          |          \
                       Pancake         ZPAY       app stores
                              \          |          /
                               verified payment events
                                         |
                                  rights intent
                                         |
                                  Permit issuer
                                         |
                              signed Permit credential
```

The dependency direction is deliberate:

```text
product  -> Rivet or Glaze
product  -> Permit
product  -> Commerce client       (only when online commerce is wanted)

Commerce service -> payment providers
Commerce service -> Permit issuer

Rivet / Glaze / Keel -X-> Commerce
Permit               -X-> Commerce
```

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) and
[Family integration](docs/family-integration.md) for the local ownership rules;
the [family architecture](https://github.com/turinglambdaai/keel/blob/main/docs/family-architecture.md)
is the canonical five-repository contract.

## Core vocabulary

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Product | Stable software identity, such as `taskly` |
| Offer | Something a customer may buy, such as `taskly-pro-lifetime` |
| Provider mapping | The Pancake/ZPAY/store identifiers that implement an offer |
| Payment event | A verified, immutable fact received from a provider |
| Order projection | Commerce's minimal local view of commercial state |
| Rights intent | An auditable request to grant, renew, replace, or withdraw rights |
| Issuance | The eventual signed Permit credential and its delivery state |

Commerce does not clone a provider's entire product catalog or customer
database. Provider objects remain the source of payment facts; Commerce stores
only the identifiers and projections required for deterministic orchestration.

## Public modules

```racket
(require commerce)           ; pure domain model and state transitions
(require commerce/provider)  ; server-side provider adapter boundary
(require commerce/journal)   ; durable event-acceptance contract
(require commerce/storage)   ; durable projection/outbox operations
(require commerce/storage/sqlite) ; SQLite service-storage backend
(require commerce/pancake)   ; Pancake authentication and active order proof
(require commerce/permit)    ; reviewed Offer policy to Permit snapshots
(require commerce/issuer)    ; explicit issuer worker: claim, sign, deliver
(require commerce/operator)  ; operator find/explain/redrive surface
(require commerce/log)       ; structured redacted event logging
```

The default `commerce` facade does not expose provider secrets, raw webhook
acceptance, network listeners, databases, or Permit signing. Those capabilities
belong to explicit server-side modules.

## Current status

Implemented now:

- exact integer minor-unit money values and stable offer identities;
- verified canonical payment events;
- provider event idempotency and conflicting-replay rejection;
- order projections that tolerate refund-before-payment delivery;
- deterministic `grant` and `withdraw` rights intents;
- a provider adapter contract and mock walkthrough;
- a durable SQLite raw-event journal with digest verification, exact replay,
  conflicting-replay rejection, and database-enforced immutable rows;
- SQLite schema v4 with in-place v1/v2/v3 migration, deterministic journal
  projection, atomic order plus issuance-outbox writes, and append-only,
  contiguous entitlement-lineage evidence;
- exact-byte Pancake RSA-SHA256 verification with explicit environment keys,
  bounded replay tolerance, mode binding, and redacted typed failures;
- signed Pancake merchant GraphQL reads that bind a completed one-time order to
  its store, environment, external checkout reference, product, succeeded
  payment, exact currency/amount, stable subject, and Offer before constructing
  a canonical payment event;
- an explicit `commerce/permit` adapter that validates version-pinned Offer
  policy through Permit and prepares complete revision-0 grants or withdrawal
  successors that expire at issuance, plus their exact serialized bytes;
- an owner-safe issuance-outbox lease state machine — exclusive claims with
  observable attempts, expired-lease reclaim, owner-checked completion, and
  typed release — whose completion appends the lineage root plus revision
  zero, or exactly one successor, together with outbox completion in one
  transaction, reconciling repeated completion to the recorded revision;
- the explicit `commerce/issuer` worker: deterministic lineage and
  credential ids, snapshot preparation, deterministic Ed25519 signing of the
  exact recorded bytes outside the claim transaction, typed refusal of
  deterministic dead ends before signing, bounded transient backoff, and
  crash reconciliation;
- one-time claim delivery: append-only signed-credential evidence, a
  random claim token stored only as its digest, explicit
  ready/claimed/expired fulfillment states with idempotent notification
  marks, and typed claim fulfillment that never advances a lineage
  revision;
- the refund and operator replay surface: redacted order explanations,
  outbox enumeration, and bounded redrive that reuses the immutable
  journal without ever editing a projection row or rewinding finished
  work;
- structured, redacted-by-construction event logging with operational
  correlation ids (journal, projection, lease, and claim transitions);
- one runnable end-to-end journey over the real protocol boundaries
  (`examples/full-journey.rkt`) and the operator runbook
  ([docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md));
- bilingual entry documentation, normative architecture, and CI gates.

Not implemented yet:

- webhook HTTP endpoints and delivery transports (email, portal);
- the operator CLI wrapper, delivery transports (email, portal), and
  live sandbox credentials (the runbook documents the drill);
- ZPAY or app-store adapters;
- refund/operator replay tooling beyond the durable lease primitives,
  subscriptions, seats, credential-claim portal, or an operator UI;
- production deployment or a claim of payment-provider certification.

The next bounded slice is the refund and operator replay flow, as
described in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Honest gaps remain visible so
architecture does not get mistaken for production readiness.
