@title{Commerce}
@author{TuringLambdaAI}

Public module: @tt{commerce}

Commerce is a provider-neutral commercial management core: authenticated
payment facts enter, deterministic order projections and rights intents leave.
It orchestrates payment providers and a Permit issuer without moving payment or
authorization policy into Rivet, Glaze, Keel, or product clients.

The default module is pure. Provider adapters explicitly require
@filepath{commerce/provider.rkt} to construct verified canonical events after
their native authentication and semantic checks.

@section{Values}

@subsection{Money}

@verbatim{
(money currency minor-units) -> money?
  currency    : string?
  minor-units : exact-nonnegative-integer?
}

Represents money exactly in the currency's smallest configured unit. Currency
is an uppercase three-letter ISO 4217 code. Floating-point amounts are rejected.

@subsection{Offer}

@verbatim{
(offer id product-id kind price entitlement-policy-id) -> offer?
  id                    : string?
  product-id            : string?
  kind                  : (or/c 'one-time 'subscription)
  price                 : money?
  entitlement-policy-id : string?
}

Describes one stable thing a customer may buy. Identifiers are lowercase
kebab-case. Provider product and price identifiers are mappings owned by the
service and are not part of this value.

@section{Projection API}

@verbatim{
(empty-commerce-state) -> commerce-state?
}

Returns an empty immutable projection state.

@verbatim{
(ingest-payment-event state event)
  -> commerce-state? (listof rights-intent?)
  state : commerce-state?
  event : payment-event?
}

Applies one previously verified provider event. Exact replay returns the same
state and an empty intent list. Conflicting replay or changed order identity
raises an @tt{exn:fail:commerce} value.

@verbatim{
(commerce-state-order state provider order-id)
  -> (or/c order-projection? #f)
}

Returns the current projection for one provider order.

@verbatim{
(commerce-state-intents state) -> (listof rights-intent?)
}

Returns all emitted rights intents sorted by their idempotency keys.

@section{Provider boundary}

Provider adapters require @filepath{commerce/provider.rkt} and construct a
canonical event only after authenticating the exact raw input, mapping the
Offer and subject, checking amount and currency, and performing any active
order lookup required by the provider contract.

@verbatim{
(make-verified-payment-event
 provider event-id payload-digest kind order-id offer-id
 subject-id amount occurred-at)
 -> payment-event?
}

Product clients must not call this function.

@section{Pancake webhook authentication}

Server processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/pancake.rkt}. This
module authenticates provider-native evidence and is not re-exported by the
default facade.

@verbatim{
(verify-pancake-webhook
 raw-body signature-header
 #:environment environment
 [#:keyring keyring]
 [#:now-ms now-ms]
 [#:past-tolerance-ms past-tolerance-ms]
 [#:future-tolerance-ms future-tolerance-ms])
 -> pancake-webhook?
  raw-body        : bytes?
  signature-header : string?
  environment     : (or/c 'test 'production)
}

Verifies the @tt{X-Waffo-Signature} RSA-SHA256 signature over the decimal
millisecond timestamp, one period byte, and the exact copied request bytes.
The default window accepts up to 45 minutes of retry age and one minute of
future clock skew. JSON parsing happens only after verification. The signed
payload's mode must match the explicitly selected environment, and duplicate
top-level fields are rejected.

The returned value exposes environment, envelope identifiers, event and store
metadata, data, immutable raw bytes, their SHA-256 digest, and the signature
timestamp through the @tt{pancake-webhook-*} accessors. It is provider-native
evidence and is not yet a canonical @tt{payment-event}.

@verbatim{
(pancake-webhook-keyring test-public-key production-public-key)
 -> pancake-webhook-keyring?
}

An explicit keyring supports controlled provider key rotation. Test and
production keys must be non-empty and distinct. Authentication and payload
failures raise redacted @tt{exn:fail:commerce} values; raw bodies, signatures,
and key contents are never included. Codes distinguish missing or malformed
signature headers, invalid or out-of-window timestamps, invalid signatures,
invalid configured public keys, invalid payloads, and environment mismatch.

@subsection{Pancake active one-time order verification}

@verbatim{
(pancake-order-binding
 merchant-external-id product-id offer-id subject-id amount currency-exponent)
 -> pancake-order-binding?
}

Records the server-side expectation created with checkout. The merchant
external id is a random correlation reference of at most 128 characters. It
maps locally to one provider product, stable Offer, opaque stable subject,
expected @tt{money} value, and explicit ISO 4217 exponent from zero through
four. It must not contain or substitute for the subject identity.

@verbatim{
(make-pancake-merchant-client
 merchant-id private-key-pem
 #:environment environment
 [#:connect-timeout-seconds connect-timeout]
 [#:request-timeout-seconds request-timeout]
 [#:transport transport]
 [#:clock clock])
 -> pancake-merchant-client?
}

Creates an opaque server-side client. The RSA private key is parsed once and is
not exposed by accessors. The client signs one @tt{POST /v1/graphql} merchant
read with RSA-SHA256/PKCS#1 v1.5. Both environments use
@tt{https://api.waffo.ai/v1/graphql}; the explicit environment is verified
against the returned order's @tt{testMode}. Defaults are five seconds to
connect and ten seconds for response headers and body. Reads follow no
redirects, carry no idempotency key, and make no implicit retry.

@verbatim{
(verify-pancake-onetime-order client webhook binding) -> payment-event?
}

Requires an authenticated @tt{order.completed} webhook, actively reads its
one-time order, and checks order id, completed status, environment, store,
merchant external id, product, the webhook payment id and succeeded status,
currency, and exact payment total. Decimal display money is converted directly
to configured minor units without floating point. Only a complete match
constructs the canonical event.

Transport failure and HTTP 408/429/5xx raise retryable
@tt{pancake-order-unavailable}. Merchant authentication, GraphQL rejection,
missing or malformed orders, and each semantic mismatch have separate typed,
redacted codes. The optional transport and clock arguments on
@tt{make-pancake-merchant-client} exist for deterministic integration testing;
production callers normally leave them at their secure defaults.

@section{Durable event journal}

Server processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/journal.rkt},
@filepath{commerce/storage.rkt}, and
@filepath{commerce/storage/sqlite.rkt}. None is re-exported from the default
product-safe facade.

@verbatim{
(open-sqlite-commerce-storage database-path) -> commerce-storage?
  database-path : path-string?
}

Opens or creates a Commerce-owned SQLite database. Schema v3 uses WAL mode,
full commit synchronization, foreign keys, and database triggers that reject
updates or deletes of accepted event and entitlement-lineage evidence. Schema
v1 and v2 databases migrate in place without rewriting existing rows. The v3
lineage tables retain stable entitlement roots and contiguous revisions with
exact unsigned Permit payload bytes; no signer or signed-credential storage is
exposed.

@verbatim{
(journal-accept! storage raw-payload event #:received-at received-at)
  -> journal-acceptance?
  storage     : commerce-storage?
  raw-payload : bytes?
  event       : payment-event?
  received-at : exact-nonnegative-integer?
}

Copies and hashes the exact authenticated bytes, then durably stores them with
the canonical payment-event snapshot. The acceptance disposition is
@tt{'accepted} for a newly committed row or @tt{'replayed} for an exact retry.
The same provider event id with changed raw or canonical content raises an
@tt{exn:fail:commerce} whose code is @tt{'event-conflict}. Digest mismatch is
rejected before persistence.

@verbatim{
(journal-ref storage provider event-id)
  -> (or/c journal-record? #f)
}

@tt{journal-ref} returns the original sequence, canonical event, immutable raw
payload, and receive time.

@section{Durable projection and issuance outbox}

Journal acknowledgement and projection are separate durability phases.
Projection runs outside the provider request:

@verbatim{
(storage-project-next! storage #:processed-at processed-at)
  -> (or/c projection-result? #f)
  processed-at : exact-nonnegative-integer?
}

Selects the lowest unprocessed journal sequence and atomically writes its order
projection, any newly emitted issuance-outbox row, and its processing marker.
It returns @tt{#f} when no sequence is pending. A successful result has
disposition @tt{'projected}; an order identity conflict has disposition
@tt{'blocked}, failure code @tt{'order-conflict}, no new outbox items, and
leaves the previous order unchanged.

@verbatim{
(storage-order-ref storage provider order-id)
  -> (or/c order-projection? #f)

(storage-outbox-ref storage idempotency-key)
  -> (or/c issuance-outbox-item? #f)

(storage-close storage) -> void?
}

@tt{projection-result} exposes disposition, journal sequence, resulting order,
new outbox items, and optional failure code. Each
@tt{issuance-outbox-item} exposes its stable idempotency key, source sequence,
rights action and commercial identifiers, occurrence time, and workflow state.
New rows are @tt{'pending} with zero attempts and no lease. Call
@tt{storage-close} during service shutdown.

@subsection{Issuance lease state machine}

The issuance worker protocol is owner-safe: a row is claimed, signed work
happens outside the claim transaction, and completion or release re-checks
the lease owner against the database.

@verbatim{
(storage-claim-issuance-work! storage
 #:owner owner #:lease-seconds lease-seconds #:now now)
  -> (or/c issuance-outbox-item? #f)
}

Claims the lowest due outbox row in one immediate transaction: status
@tt{'processing}, attempts incremented by one, and an opaque exclusive lease
bound to the owner. A row is due when it is @tt{'pending} and
@tt{available_at <= now}, or when its lease has expired. Returns @tt{#f}
when nothing is due.

@verbatim{
(storage-complete-issuance-work! storage item
 #:issuer issuer #:subject-type subject-type
 #:entitlement-id entitlement-id #:credential-id credential-id
 #:policy-id policy-id #:policy-version policy-version
 #:payload-bytes payload-bytes #:issued-at issued-at
 #:recorded-at recorded-at)
  -> issuance-completion?
}

Appends the lineage root together with revision zero, or exactly one
successor revision, and completes the outbox row inside the same short
transaction. The writer enforces the ADR-0008 identity rules as typed
failures before any insert: a second grant over an existing lineage, a
commercial identity bound to a different entitlement, a withdrawal without
a lineage, and a credential id already bound to another revision raise
@tt{exn:fail:commerce} codes @tt{'entitlement-lineage-conflict} or
@tt{'entitlement-lineage-required} and write nothing. The payload digest is
computed from the given bytes, never trusted from the caller. Completion
without the active lease raises @tt{'lease-not-held}. Repeating a completion
that already landed reconciles to the recorded revision; the same outbox id
with different payload bytes is a conflict.

@verbatim{
(storage-release-issuance-work! storage item
 #:error-code error-code #:retry-at retry-at)
  -> issuance-outbox-item?
}

Returns transient work to @tt{'pending} with the typed error code recorded
and a future retry time. Only the lease owner may release; attempts stay
exactly as the claim incremented them.

@verbatim{
(storage-entitlement-ref storage entitlement-id)
  -> (or/c entitlement-lineage? #f)

(storage-lineage-ref storage #:issuer issuer #:subject-type subject-type
 #:subject-id subject-id #:offer-id offer-id)
  -> (or/c entitlement-lineage? #f)

(storage-entitlement-revision-ref storage entitlement-id revision)
  -> (or/c entitlement-revision? #f)

(storage-latest-entitlement-revision storage entitlement-id)
  -> (or/c entitlement-revision? #f)
}

Readers expose durable lineage and revision state for worker snapshot
preparation, crash reconciliation, and audit. Revision payload bytes are the
exact unsigned snapshot bytes, never signed credential bytes. No Permit
signing, signed-credential persistence, claim delivery, or HTTP listener is
included in this boundary.

@section{Offer-to-Permit policy mapping}

Server processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/permit.rkt}. This
module imports the published @tt{permit/issuer} snapshot surface; it is not
re-exported from the default facade and never accesses a signing key.

@verbatim{
(make-permit-grant-policy
 [#:products products]
 [#:product-families product-families]
 [#:edition edition]
 [#:feature-policy feature-policy]
 [#:features features]
 [#:addons addons]
 [#:capabilities capabilities])
 -> permit-grant-policy?
}

Constructs one reviewed grant policy. Optional Commerce values use @tt{#f};
the adapter translates absence to Permit @tt{null}. The smart constructor
validates the resulting grant through Permit's complete entitlement schema.
Feature policy is @tt{'explicit} or @tt{'published-through}.

@verbatim{
(make-permit-constraints-policy
 [#:use-expires-at use-expires-at]
 [#:updates-through updates-through]
 [#:features-through features-through]
 [#:version-min version-min]
 [#:version-max version-max]
 [#:named-seats named-seats]
 [#:device-activations device-activations]
 [#:concurrent-seats concurrent-seats]
 [#:installation-id installation-id]
 [#:activation-required? activation-required?])
 -> permit-constraints-policy?
}

Constructs the complete constraints policy and validates timestamps, SemVer
bounds, limits, installation binding, and activation shape through Permit.

@verbatim{
(make-permit-entitlement-policy
 id version
 #:subject-type subject-type
 #:grants grants
 [#:constraints constraints]
 [#:withdrawal-mode 'expire-at-issuance])
 -> permit-entitlement-policy?

(make-permit-policy-catalog
 offers policies
 [#:deleted-offer-ids deleted-offer-ids])
 -> permit-policy-catalog?
}

Policy ids are immutable revisions; the positive integer version is audit
metadata and never selects a mutable latest policy. The catalog contains both
active and retained retired Offer definitions. Explicit deletion tombstones
are distinct from never-known Offer ids. Every Offer's product must occur in
the explicit product scope of its pinned policy.

@verbatim{
(prepare-permit-snapshot
 catalog intent
 #:issuer issuer
 #:credential-id credential-id
 #:entitlement-id entitlement-id
 #:issued-at issued-at
 [#:previous previous])
 -> permit-snapshot-request?
}

For @tt{'grant}, creates a complete entitlement at revision 0 and rejects an
existing lineage. For @tt{'withdraw}, requires the previous complete snapshot,
checks issuer, entitlement id, subject, type, and grants, advances its revision,
and sets @tt{use_expires_at} to the new @tt{issued_at}. This communicates an
issuance-expiring successor to connected clients; it does not revoke an old
offline credential.

The result exposes policy id/version, action, source idempotency key, the
validated complete payload, and @tt{permit-snapshot-request-payload-bytes}.
The payload tree and bytes are immutable copies. Those bytes are Permit's
single serialization and are the only bytes a later signer may sign.
Unknown/deleted Offers, invalid policy/catalog/request data,
unsupported kinds/actions, and missing or conflicting lineage raise typed
@tt{exn:fail:commerce} values. No outbox mutation, lineage persistence,
signing, or delivery happens in this operation.

@verbatim{
(permit-policy-for-offer catalog offer-id)
  -> permit-entitlement-policy?
}

Resolves the pinned policy for one Offer with the same typed failures as
snapshot preparation, so a worker can fail before signing.

@section{Explicit issuer worker}

Server processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/issuer.rkt}. This
module imports the published @tt{permit/issuer} signing surface; the default
facade never does. The worker owns no durable state: every decision derives
from the claimed outbox row, the pinned catalog, and recorded lineage.

@verbatim{
(make-issuance-worker
 #:catalog catalog #:issuer issuer
 #:private-key private-key #:key-id key-id
 #:trust-store trust-store
 [#:clock clock] [#:owner owner]
 [#:lease-seconds lease-seconds]
 [#:transient-backoff-seconds transient-backoff]
 [#:operator-backoff-seconds operator-backoff])
  -> issuance-worker?
}

Binds one reviewed catalog, issuer identity, Ed25519 private key, trust
store key id, and trust store behind one opaque worker value. The private
key is never exposed by an accesssor. The clock returns two values, an
epoch second and its RFC 3339 string; the default reads wall-clock UTC.

@verbatim{
(process-issuance-work! worker storage)
  -> (or/c issuance-result? #f)
}

Claims one due outbox row and drives it: deterministic dead ends are
released with their typed commerce code and an operator backoff before any
signing; a grant with no lineage signs revision zero and a withdrawal signs
an issuance-expiring successor naming the latest revision; the exact
recorded bytes are signed outside the claim transaction, and the revision,
the signed envelope, and a one-time claim are recorded in one transaction.
The result's claim token is delivered to the caller exactly once for a
single customer handoff. Returns @tt{#f} when nothing is due.
Dispositions: @tt{'completed} with the storage completion record and claim
token, @tt{'released} with the typed error code, or @tt{'lease-lost} when
the lease expired between claim and completion, in which case nothing was
written. Permit signing failures release as @tt{'permit-issue-failed} with
the transient backoff; the same durable work completes after repair.

@verbatim{
(derive-entitlement-id issuer subject-type subject-id offer-id)
  -> string?

(derive-credential-id entitlement-id revision)
  -> string?
}

Deterministic lineage and credential identifiers. Reprocessing never
allocates a second lineage or revision; a crash after signing converges
because Ed25519 re-signs identical bytes to an identical signature.

@subsection{One-time claim delivery}

The issued credential record retains the exact signed envelope bytes; the
claim stores only the token's SHA-256 digest. No transport or HTTP
listener is included in this boundary.

@verbatim{
(storage-claim-credential storage #:token token #:now now)
  -> claim-fulfillment?
}

Verifies the token, its state, and its fulfillment window, marks the claim
claimed, and returns the claim id, the fulfillment time, and the
@tt{issued-credential-record} with the exact signed envelope bytes, which
verify as a Permit envelope for the recorded key id. Wrong, reused, and
expired tokens raise typed @tt{exn:fail:commerce} values
(@tt{'claim-not-found}, @tt{'claim-already-claimed},
@tt{'claim-expired}) and mutate nothing. Fulfillment never creates or
advances a lineage revision.

@verbatim{
(storage-mark-claim-notified storage #:token token #:now now) -> void?
}

Records that a delivery transport handed the token out. The first
notification timestamp wins; later retries are idempotent no-ops.

@verbatim{
(storage-complete-issuance-work! storage item ...
 [#:signed-credential-bytes envelope-bytes]
 [#:key-id key-id]
 [#:claim-token claim-token]
 [#:claim-expires-at claim-expires-at])
}

The optional delivery half of completion: when the exact signed envelope
bytes and key id are supplied, the completion transaction also records the
issued credential; a claim token and expiry add its one-time fulfillment
claim. Omitting them records issuance evidence without delivery, as before.

@section{Operator replay surface}

Server processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/operator.rkt}. The
surface answers operator questions without exposing raw provider bytes;
deep journal payload access stays behind @filepath{commerce/journal.rkt}.

@verbatim{
(find-issuance-work storage [#:status status])
  -> (listof issuance-outbox-item?)

(explain-order storage provider order-id)
  -> order-explanation?
}

Enumeration is read-only and stable by id. The explanation carries the
order projection, the canonical event snapshots (never raw provider
payloads), the order's outbox work, and its issued-credential records if
any.

@verbatim{
(redrive-issuance-work! storage idempotency-key #:now now)
  -> issuance-outbox-item?
}

Makes one @tt{'pending} row due immediately without touching its attempts
counter — the bounded answer to transient failures and short backoffs. It
refuses to rewind in-flight work (@tt{'lease-not-held}) or completed work
(@tt{'work-already-completed}), and unknown keys fail with
@tt{'unknown-issuance-work}. Replay always reuses the immutable journal
through the normal projection path; no operation edits a projection row.

@section{Structured event logging}

Processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/log.rkt} to observe their
own transitions. Events are structured and redacted by construction:
correlation keys are a closed whitelist (provider, event id, order id,
subject, offer, outbox work, entitlement and revision, claim, sequence)
and field values are redaction-safe scalars — strings, exact integers,
booleans, and kebab-case workflow or error symbols. Raw provider bytes,
tokens, and unlisted keys are rejected before emission.

@verbatim{
(log-commerce-event! level code correlation fields) -> void?
  level       : (member level '(debug info warning error))
  code        : symbol?
  correlation : (hash/c symbol? (or/c string? exact-nonnegative-integer? #f))
  fields      : (hash/c symbol? redaction-safe-scalar)
}

Public surfaces instrument their own transitions: journal acceptance and
conflict, projection and blocking, lease claim/complete/release, redrive,
and claim fulfillment or refusal. Exact replays and idle polling log at
@tt{'debug}; transitions log at @tt{'info}; conflicts, refusals, and lost
leases log at @tt{'warning}. Transport formatting and shipping are
deployment concerns.

@section{Readiness and health}

Processes explicitly require @filepath{commerce/health.rkt}.

@verbatim{
(storage-readiness storage #:now now) -> readiness?
}

One read-only aggregate: schema version, journal and projection counts,
pending and processing issuance work with a stale-lease count, the oldest
pending availability time, and claim state counts including the
window-passed count.

@verbatim{
(health-report storage #:now now) -> health-status?
(health-report! storage #:now now) -> health-status?
}

Classifies the snapshot into typed warnings — @tt{'projection-blocked},
@tt{'issuance-lease-expired}, @tt{'claim-window-passed} — and the logging
variant emits them on the commerce topic. Nothing mutates; an HTTP edge
would render this value.

@section{Operator CLI}

@tt{raco commerce find|explain|redrive} wraps
@filepath{commerce/operator.rkt} for one service database. Output is JSON
with redacted summaries; @tt{redrive} exits 0 on success and 1 with a
typed code on refusal.

@section{First purchase}

@verbatim{
#lang racket/base

(require commerce
         commerce/provider)

(define paid
  (make-verified-payment-event
   "mock" "evt_1" (make-string 64 #\a)

(define-values (state intents)
  (ingest-payment-event (empty-commerce-state) paid))
}

The complete architecture, provider rules, security model, operations contract,
and Permit integration are maintained in the repository's @filepath{docs/}
