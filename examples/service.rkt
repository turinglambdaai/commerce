#lang racket/base

;; Role-selectable assembly of the HTTP edge and the signing/projector worker.
;; Edge and issuer may run as different OS users over the same SQLite store.
;; Splitting role processes removes raw Permit key access from the web process
;; but does not make their shared writable database a trusted signing boundary.
;;
;; Run it only after reading docs/runbook.md and deploy/README.md. The
;; catalog below is a placeholder: replace it with your product's
;; reviewed, version-pinned policy before accepting real payments.
;;
;; Termination: SIGTERM/SIGKILL is crash-safe by design (WAL +
;; synchronous=FULL; a restart re-claims expired leases and re-projects
;; from the immutable journal). A clean shutdown posts the stop
;; semaphore and closes the store.
