# ADR-0020: Split Commerce edge and issuer service roles

Status: **accepted as an incremental hardening step; not the final trust boundary**

## Problem

The former example assembled the public HTTP listener, provider merchant
credential, payment projector, and Permit private signing key in one process.
Compromise of that HTTP-facing process therefore exposed an unrelated
commercial signing secret. Signing and claim delivery remain distinct from
webhook processing in the application model, but not in OS privileges.

## Decision

The service accepts `COMMERCE_ROLE=all|edge|issuer`. `all` retains the
combined local demonstration. An edge-only process reads Pancake credentials
and webhook verification keys, but never resolves `PERMIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`,
creates a Permit signer, or starts the issuance thread. An issuer-only process
reads the Permit signing key and a pinned product policy catalog, runs the
projector and outbox worker, and starts **no HTTP listener**. Both roles share
one SQLite WAL database and honor the same environment and database path.

Two different unprivileged OS identities, mutually inaccessible key files,
separate environment configuration and systemd hardening are required to
obtain actual process-level key confidentiality. Starting two processes
under one account or running two root containers with shared secrets does not
provide the intended isolation. The examples have no privileged key-export
endpoint.

## Security boundary and limitations

This design narrows *key confidentiality exposure*, not signing authority.
Both processes still have write access to the same database. A compromised
edge with arbitrary database write access could forge payment journal,
projection or outbox records, and thus trick the issuer into signing
unauthorized rights. Database triggers and idempotency protect ordinary
application mistakes, not arbitrary malicious SQL from a writable role.
No claim of a fully isolated trustworthy signer is warranted.

A subsequent milestone must require an independently authenticated,
least-privilege signing-intent channel, or a durable verified evidence
boundary in which the HTTP process cannot forge issuer-authorized work.
Test attempted payment/order forgery, wrong issuer/key/environment, actor
restarts, delayed or duplicate messages, and signer outage before claiming
production signing separation.

## Expected behavior

- `edge`: requires provider/HTTP configuration and shared database;
  **does not require or read any Permit private key path**.
- `issuer`: requires Permit issuer, trust store, private key, policy catalog
  and shared database; **does not require provider keys or bind HTTP**.
- `all`: backward-compatible for `COMMERCE_ENVIRONMENT=test` mock/local
  walkthroughs only; `production` refuses it before reading secrets or
  opening storage, even if the operator leaves `COMMERCE_ROLE` unset.
- A missing or invalid role fails closed on startup. No role is allowed to
  silently fall back to `all` after invalid input.
- Webhook acceptance remains durable before acknowledgements, and signing
  stays asynchronous. A crashed issuer is restarted by the service manager.
  An issuer restart reclaims expired outbox leases; clients and operators
  must not issue another charge for an unknown entitlement outcome.

## Verification and release gate

Unit tests check role selection, invalid roles and forbidden role
capabilities. CI compiles the role-selectable example on all supported
Racket versions and OSes; a Docker build exercises packaging. These checks
do not prove OS permission isolation or live merchant behavior. Before
any production cutover, inspect effective `systemd` permissions, verify
that the edge OS identity cannot open the issuer private key, ensure
the issuer has no listening socket, rehearse WAL permissions and multi-process
restart/recovery on a staging database, and record exact artifact SHAs.

The original combined service unit remains a compatibility demonstration.
See `deploy/README.md` for the opt-in split unit templates.
