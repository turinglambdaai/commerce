# Documentation map

Commerce keeps one canonical document for each durable decision. README files
teach the first path; normative documents define behavior; runbooks explain
operations. Do not duplicate a rule across several guides.

## Start here

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) · [中文](getting-started.zh-CN.md) —
  install, run the walkthrough, and understand the first edit points.
- [Concepts](concepts.md) — Product, Offer, payment event, projection, rights
  intent, issuance, and claim.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — ownership, dependency direction, data flow,
  process boundaries, and consistency model.

## Integration contracts

- [Provider contract](provider-contract.md) — what every Pancake, ZPAY, or
  store adapter must prove before emitting a canonical event.
- [Permit integration](permit-integration.md) — how rights intents become
  complete signed credential revisions.
- [Family integration](family-integration.md) — Commerce's local edges to
  Rivet, Glaze, Keel, Permit, products, and identity systems; it links to the
  canonical five-repository architecture.

## Production work

- [Security](security.md) — trust domains, webhook authentication, keys,
  personal data, and failure behavior.
- [Operations](operations.md) — replay, stuck work, refunds, reconciliation,
  backup/restore, and observability requirements.
- [Runbook](runbook.md) — the operator's question-by-question answers with
  the runnable end-to-end journey.
- [Deploying](../deploy/README.md) — configuration, systemd, and Docker
  for the canonical service assembly.
- [Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md) — bounded implementation milestones.
